# Sassquatch

An in development sass based component library with heavy emphasis on accessibility.

## Requirements

To make full use of Sassquatch's features your project should already have a SCSS compiler. This will allow you to import sassquatch.scss and make use of mixins and variables.

Otherwise you can include the precompiled sassquatch.css to get the default component styles.
