# Sassquatch

## Requirements

### Node.js
https://nodejs.org/en/

### Gulp
run 'npm install --global gulp-cli' in command line

## Running the project
- From the root directory run 'gulp build'. This will compile all your assets and templates.
- To run a server run 'gulp serve'. This will open the project in your default browser, watch your project files for changes, and auto reload whenever changes are made.
- To watch for changes without running a server simply run the default task 'gulp'

A .env file is included for updating paths on a per project basis.
